# Method

In May 2019, I surveyed two groups of self-employed software developers. One group was a convenience opt-in sample from LinkedIn, and the other was a convenience opt-in sample from my ~2,000-member email list. I screened both samples by asking whether participants had spent time or money on career development in the last 2 years.

- 22 people from LinkedIn completed the survey.
- 33 people from my email list completed the survey.
- The median age of respondents is 42 (LinkedIn sample) and 41 (list sample).
- 64% of the LinkedIn sample have invested in their career in some way. 36% have not.
- 95% of the email list sample have invested in their career in some way. 5% have not.

I'm Philip Morgan Consulting, and I'm focused on helping dev shops cultivate, commercialize, and monetize expertise. 

There's an underlying tension inherent in this expertise project: what dev shops need to do to cultivate exceptionally valuable expertise is often in direct conflict with what they need to do to serve clients -- and generate revenue -- today. My work helps resolve this tension.

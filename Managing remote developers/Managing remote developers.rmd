This research used a short, focused questionnaire. Below are the summarized responses to each question.

## Q: "In the last year, have you recommended working remotely to others?"

Of the 45 respondents who had managed dev team that is overseas OR a remote/distributed team that has just 2 or 3 hours/day of time zone overlap in the last year, 86.7% recommended it to others.

## Q: How many people are part of the team you manage?

# Method

In May 2019, I surveyed a group of Tech Leads and VP's of Engineering from Computer Software, Internet, and Information Technology and Services companies. This group was a convenience opt-in sample recruited using LinkedIn. I screened respondents by asking "In the last year, have you managed a dev team that is overseas OR a remote/distributed team that has just 2 or 3 hours/day of time zone overlap with you?"

- 56 people from LinkedIn completed the survey. 45 (80%) moved beyond the screener question.

I'm Philip Morgan, and I'm focused on helping dev shops cultivate, commercialize, and monetize expertise. 

There's an underlying tension inherent in this expertise project: what dev shops need to do to cultivate exceptionally valuable expertise is often in direct conflict with what they need to do to serve clients -- and generate revenue -- today. My work helps resolve this tension.
